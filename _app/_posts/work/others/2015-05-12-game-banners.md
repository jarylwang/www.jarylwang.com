<h2><center>Ragnarok Online</center></h2>

<p>For quite some time, I ran a banner request thread on the <a href="http://forum.ratemyserver.net/ro-graphic-coding-media/banner-request-thread/30/" title="RMS Forums">RateMyServer Forums</a>, accepting requests for private game server admins to request a banner, <strong>FOC</strong>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I lost most of the banners (which were mostly animated) due to a web host migration and <em><strong>VERY TIMELY</strong></em> faulty hard drive, and these were the only 2 left.</p>

<h2><center>MU Online</center></h2>

<p>This was done very very long ago, and was actually my maiden attempt at grunge style signatures/banners.
